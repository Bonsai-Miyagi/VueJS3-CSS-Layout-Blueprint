Every section is treated as a separated element. Except for content and sidebar. 

The article data can be modified to add more articles in the article.json file. 

This data is rendered on the BodyComponent.vue

Also it has a scrollbar. You can change the color on main.css

This is just a template and I know it can be better.

<!-- Limitations -->
## Limitations

This is just a simple template project and there are several areas for improvement. For example, the application could be made more responsive, the article data could be loaded from a remote source, and the scrollbar could be made more customizable.
